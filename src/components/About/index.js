        Hi! My name is Jacob Nordan, I'm from Wilmington, NC, and I recently
        attended and completed the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's
        Coding Bootcamp with an A+. I mainly use the MERN tech stack due to its
        flexibility and performance in developing interactive user interfaces.
